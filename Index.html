	<h1>About Me!</h1>
	<article>
		<p>Hi! I'm Kevin McFall, I'm 23 years old, and I was born on May 10th, 1994. I live in Illinois, where all the snow loves to stay in through the Spring! Seriously though, I grew up in Illinois and still live in the same state, although I'm in a different area now. I used to go to Elgin Community College (ECC) until a couple years ago, and when my family and I moved, I had to go to Waubonsee instead since it was closer.</p>
		<br />
		<p>What I generally like to do outside of school is mostly play video games, go on my laptop and surf the web, and watch animated shows meant for adults. I do outside things too! When the temperature is just right, I like to go out for walks, and even walk my dog! </p>
		<br />
		<p>Down below, you can find the description for all the pages on here!</p>
