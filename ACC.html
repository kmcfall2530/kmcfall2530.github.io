	<h1>What is ACC?</h1>
	<article>
	<p>ACC or Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum, is an extremely rare brain disorder that is not known by many doctors, but neurologists do know that they only happen when the child is still developing in the mother, and the Corpus Callosum fails to develop in the brain. It can affect the person who has it, mentally and physically. It usually takes a lengthy amount of time for the child to learn how to basic things, like learning how to walk, talk, write, ride a bike, going to the bathroom, etc. Also, low muscle tone can also occur.</p>
	<br />
	<p>People who have a partial Corpus Callosum are more highly functioning than others who have a Corpus Callosum that has failed to develop. Unfortunately for those with an absent Corpus Callosum, they don't function very well and can barely speak properly at an older age</p>

	<h1>My Personal Experience</h1>
	<article>
	<p>Now that you've got the gist of it feels like to have ACC, here's my experience with it!
	When I was 3 years old, I was diagnosed with ACC. I didn't know how to walk, talk or do anything a normal toddler could learn within a shorter time. So, I was more of a late developer and didn't learn basic things until I got older. I started in a Special Ed. school where they taught special needs kids that couldn't learn on their own. After all of that, I developed more and felt like a more normal person but I still had a disability that still hindered my abilities. In school, or more specifically, homework or tests, it would take a longer time to think, and I'd usually run out of time and I'd either get a good or bad grade. But, mostly good! I still didn't know how to tie my shoes either, so I would leave them untied for the rest of the day until my mom fixed that problem for me. In Middle School, around 7th grade, I learned I have ACC. I was confused at first as to what it exactly was, but then I eventually understood. I thought it wasn't awful at first since I felt like I acted like a normal kid, but I still felt different. From then on, I'd tell my friends about it, and the teachers gave me more time to work on tests. To this day, I still struggle with some things still, but I'm always working my way up toward my goals! </p>
